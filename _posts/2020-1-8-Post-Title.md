here is the summery of what have we done  with our personal website for the  computer lab lesson:

1 -first we have forked and cloned the address of a general website from our profossors github page to access the files and folders, so we achieved  the ability to change differrent things on it such as changing the name, emails , profile pictures putting pictures and so on; finally our primary personal webite was made :)

2- second, we had to put 2 blog postes about how to recycle an old harddisk drive(such as putting a video link or posting it like a picture) and how to manage our time 

3.the last one is what im doing here now, make a summery of what had we just done with our personal website  :)
